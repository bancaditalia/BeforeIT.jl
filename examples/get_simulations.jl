# The following code loads the parameters and initial conditions,
# it initialises the model, runs the model `n_sims` times, and finally
# saves the `data_vector` into a `.jld2` file with an appropriate name.
# The whole process is repeatead for all quarters from `2010Q1` to `2019Q4`,
# and for all years from 2010 to 2019.
