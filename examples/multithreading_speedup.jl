# Note that households are the sum of active and inactive households and the owners of firms and of the bank
println(length(model.w_act) + length(model.w_inact) + length(model.firms) + 1)

# Let's fist check how many threads we have available in this Julia session

# Is the speedup in line to what we would expect?
