# In this tutorial we illustrate how to calibrate the model to the Italian data for a specific quarter

import BeforeIT as Bit

using Dates, FileIO

# We start from loading the calibration object for italy, which contains 
# 4 datasets: `calibration_data`, `figaro`, `data`, and `ea`. These are
# saved within `BeforeIT.jl` for the Italian case, and would need to be
# appropriately generated for other countries.

cal = Bit.ITALY_CALIBRATION
fieldnames(typeof(cal))

# These are essentially 4 dictionaries with well defined keys, such as

println(keys(cal.calibration))
println(keys(cal.figaro))
println(keys(cal.data))
println(keys(cal.ea))

# The object also contains two time variables related to the data

println(cal.max_calibration_date)
println(cal.estimation_date)

# We can calibrate the model on a specific quarter as follows

calibration_date = DateTime(2010, 03, 31)
parameters, initial_conditions = Bit.get_params_and_initial_conditions(cal, calibration_date; scale = 0.01)

# In general, we might want to repeat this operation for multiple quarters.
# In the following, we loop over all quarters from `2010Q1` to `2019Q4`
# and save the parameters and initial conditions in separate files.
# We can then load these files later to run the model for each quarter.
