# # Multithreading speedup for large models

# In this tutorial we illustrate how to make use of multi threading in `BeforeIT.jl`
# to allow for faster executions of single simulation runs.

import BeforeIT as Bit

using FileIO, Plots, StatsPlots

# First, we initialise the model, this time we use the Italy 2010Q1 scenario, 
# and we want to simulate the model for a large number of epochs

parameters = Bit.ITALY2010Q1.parameters
initial_conditions = Bit.ITALY2010Q1.initial_conditions
T = 50
model = Bit.init_model(parameters, initial_conditions, T);

# The model is in scale 1:2000, so it has around 30,000 households
model.prop.H

# Note that the households number is actually the sum of active and
# inactive households, the owners of firms and of the bank
length(model.w_act) + length(model.w_inact) + length(model.firms) + 1

# Let's fist check how many threads we have available in this Julia session
Threads.nthreads()

# Then we need to first compile the code not to count compilation time,
# we can do that just by executing the function one time
Bit.run!(model; multi_threading = false);

# Let's now compare the performance of single threading and multi threading
model = Bit.init_model(parameters, initial_conditions, T);
@time data = Bit.run!(model; multi_threading = false);

model = Bit.init_model(parameters, initial_conditions, T);
@time data = Bit.run!(model; multi_threading = true);

# Is the speedup in line to what we would expect? Yes!
