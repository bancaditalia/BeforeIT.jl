function dmtest_modified(e1::Vector{Float64}, e2::Vector{Float64}, h::Int=1)
    #DMTEST: Retrieves the Diebold-Mariano test statistic (1995) for the 
    # equality of forecast accuracy of two forecasts under general assumptions.
    #
    #   DM = dmtest(e1, e2, ...) calculates the D-M test statistic on the base 
    #   of the loss differential which is defined as the difference of the 
    #   squared forecast errors
    #
    #   In particular, with the DM statistic one can test the null hypothesis: 
    #   H0: E(d) = 0. The Diebold-Mariano test assumes that the loss 
    #   differential process 'd' is stationary and defines the statistic as:
    #   DM = mean(d) / sqrt[ (1/T) * VAR(d) ]  ~ N(0,1),
    #   where VAR(d) is an estimate of the unconditional variance of 'd'.
    #
    #   This function also corrects for the autocorrelation that multi-period 
    #   forecast errors usually exhibit. Note that an efficient h-period 
    #   forecast will have forecast errors following MA(h-1) processes. 
    #   Diebold-Mariano use a Newey-West type estimator for sample variance of
    #   the loss differential to account for this concern.
    #
    #   'e1' is a 'T1-by-1' vector of the forecast errors from the first model
    #   'e2' is a 'T2-by-1' vector of the forecast errors from the second model
    #
    #   It should hold that T1 = T2 = T.
    #
    #   DM = DMTEST(e1, e2, 'h') allows you to specify an additional parameter 
    #   value 'h' to account for the autocorrelation in the loss differential 
    #   for multi-period ahead forecasts.   
    #       'h'         the forecast horizon, initially set equal to 1
    #
    #   DM = DMTEST(...) returns a constant:
    #       'DM'      the Diebold-Mariano (1995) test statistic
