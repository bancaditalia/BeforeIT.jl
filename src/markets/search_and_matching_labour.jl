    search_and_matching_labour(firms::Firms, model)

This function implements a labor search and matching algorithm. It takes in a `Firms` object and a `Model` object as 
input. The `Firms` object contains information about the number of desired employees (`N_d_i`) and the current number 
of employees (`N_i`) for each firm. The `model` object contains information about the current employment 
status (`O_h`) of each worker.

The function performs the following steps:
- Calculates the vacancies (`V_i`) for each firm as the difference between desired and current employees.
- Identifies employed workers and shuffles them randomly.
- Fires workers from firms with negative vacancies to adjust the workforce.
- Identifies unemployed workers and firms with positive vacancies.
- Randomly matches unemployed workers to firms with vacancies until all vacancies are filled or there are no more unemployed workers.

The function returns:
- `N_i`: An updated array of the number of employed workers for each firm.
- `O_h`: An updated array where each element represents the firm a worker is employed with (0 if unemployed).
